MCMC-Simulation
===============

This is a Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulation program, 
written in MATLAB, which prompts users to input appropriate data 
(time-series functions, markov chain order, etc.) and outputs a 
simulated version of that data. It is a useful tool for generating
potential future data (for wind power, wind speed, electricity 
prices, etc.) which can be used to determine what kind of wind 
farms, retrofits, etc. should be implemented.
